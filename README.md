# Tracking-Dapp-on-Flow
A dapp for Task Tracking on Flow Blockchain where every user can manage their own list of tasks they need to do, and can only add/update tasks within their own list - and not in someone else's list.


# Flow Blockchain:
Flow is a Layer-1 blockchain that is designed to be highly scalable without the need of sharding. It utilizes a multi-role architecture that makes it unique from other blockchains, and allows it to scale vertically.

The Flow blockchain is built by Dapper Labs, the company behind CryptoKitties, the ERC-721 standard for NFTs, and NBA Topshot.

By not depending on sharding, Flow provides a more developer-friendly and validator-friendly environment to build on or run nodes for Flow.
